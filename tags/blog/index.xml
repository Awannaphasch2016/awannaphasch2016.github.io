      <description>Straight&amp;rsquo;s recipe is similar but not identify to one used by MELPA. 1
A recipe describes which local repository to link the files from and how to clone that repository, if repo is not found locally. With this definition of recipe, one can think of recipe as a build step (recipe) of a package.
Ultimately, a package is defined is a collection of files required for package&amp;rsquo;s build. striaght.el views a package in this manner.</description>

      <description>This article is based on staright.el README which at the moment doesn&amp;rsquo;t have written document on how transaction works. So This is a work in progress until I either read straight.el codebase or summarize its documentation.
Conceptually, stright.el clones Git repo and them symlinking files into Emacs&amp;rsquo;s load path. A packages in straight.el is defined as recipe as a files which was symlinked together. I have an article on recipe.</description>

      <description>When I first get into Emacs, I was a vim user before, so I picked up Doom Emacs without experience with vanilla Emacs. Transition has been smooth so far, but because I never has experience with Vanilla Emacs before when I encounter a bug in Doom Emacs. I always have to first figure out if it is Doom Emacs problem or Emacs problems. Because of this, I put out a new blog series to help me build a stronger foundation of Vanilla Emacs.</description>

      <description>This article is an opinion piece on Comparison to other package managers.
Emacs package manager are split into 2 categories: package.el wrapper or not package.el wrapper.
One idea that straight.el emphasizes a lot is that straight.el manages commits rather than managing a whole a package. Some PM only accept latest commit. Other only accepts repo on github etc. I call this design decision a &amp;ldquo;smallest unit of design implementation.&amp;rdquo;
Other unique takes on managing Emacs packages are Borg (assimilates packages as Git submodules into .</description>

      <description>Personally, I think snippets is under untilize. Same as notes. The fact is people just don&amp;rsquo;t do neither snippets or notes.
I defined code snippet as followed
 A collection of either small/large code which may store in single/multiple files that you will revisit against in the future.
 Focusing on manging code snippets in emacs, few packages come to mind including: yassnipet, auto-yasnippet, yankpad, and code library.
In my workflow, to share code snippet with others, gists is needed.</description>

      <description>Dev logs is new blog series which dive deep into implementation level. The goal is to understand how things works. I figure this should be an interesting series because I always wanted to know how these program works underneath. Instead of explaining the whole code base, I will only focus on the &amp;ldquo;magical&amp;rdquo; part that sparked my interest the most.
Todays I present to you aya.
I started of the series with aya because, I think, it is a small package with the right portion of magic.</description>

  In this section, we will focus on denominations of Ethers. The goal is to provide more concrete example into denomination of a coin.
If you are familiar with Etherem, we have heard Wei and GWei. These are not the only two denominators of Ethers. List of all denominators of Ether is shown in Fig. which is from Etherem yellow paper (aka.</description>

Keymap Precendence in vanilla emacs  overriding-terminal-local-map for terminal-specific key bind overriding-local-map keymap char property at point keymaps for the current character. Yasnippet keymaps are in this category. emulation-mode-map-alists. Apparently, its more multi-mode keymap management. I am not sure what this means, but if i have to guess it is used in modes that have its known key precedence or other complexity that its key binding system brings.</description>

I successfully connect x-apps via x11 protocol by first installing and launching xming server. Xming application provides x11-server. Then, I need to tell the wsl2 &amp;ldquo;address and port of X11 server to connect wsl2 application to&amp;rdquo; (my note on x11 can be seen here) X11 server is enlisted as WSL2 entrusted DNS which located in resolve.conf.

This is the beginning of the essay.
The four phases are categorized into the following

      <description>You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:
`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`
Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file.</description>

Auto-Yasnippet (aka aya) provides the following interactive commands: aya-create, aya-expand, aya-persiste-snippet, and aya-open-line:
I don&amp;rsquo;t quite understand aya-open-line yet, so I will not be explaining it here.

      <description>Doom Emacs has its own keybinding system. A more accurate access would be Doom Emacs keybinding system is a wrapper over evil mode such that it is smoothly compatible with Emacs.
If you use Evil mode without Emacs configuration framework such as Spacemacs or Doom Emacs, it is frustrating to know if your keybinding is setup properly and will always work as expected at any circumstances. The usually point of failure is when your keybinding is overwritten by other packages.</description>

      <description>The normal workflow of lookup documentation would be to search google, stack-overflow, etc. Alternatively, if you are using IDE, IDE will lookup documentation for you, for example goto-definition etc. Very convenience. What else do you need?
Although, searching online directly is not the best approach, it is everyone last line of defense. On the other hands, IDE is as good as it gets. However, the problem with IDE is that it is context specific.</description>

 organize files. write notes on a file. search files and notes (aka completion in emacs) organize notes reference to file.  First two are easy to achieve. Put notes and pdf files in folders does the job. The third condition is arguably not difficult neither. One can search for a file given a file directory quickly which can be done with any of the completion packages (e.</description>
