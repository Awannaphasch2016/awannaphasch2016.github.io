      <description>First of all, I am no expert in LaTeX. I am just a dude who has (a lot) of trouble installing LaTeX and was trying to solve it.
From this experience, I learn important lesson is always start digging from the official documentation of the target packages/libraries. This is because there are many two types of solution in general: general solution and environment specific solution.
In this case, its clearly a environment specific problem which required environemnt speicific solution.</description>

      <title>A Note On Straight&#39;s Recipe.</title>

      <description>Straight&amp;rsquo;s recipe is similar but not identify to one used by MELPA. 1
A recipe describes which local repository to link the files from and how to clone that repository, if repo is not found locally. With this definition of recipe, one can think of recipe as a build step (recipe) of a package.
Ultimately, a package is defined is a collection of files required for package&amp;rsquo;s build. striaght.el views a package in this manner.</description>

      <description>This article is based on staright.el README which at the moment doesn&amp;rsquo;t have written document on how transaction works. So This is a work in progress until I either read straight.el codebase or summarize its documentation.
Conceptually, stright.el clones Git repo and them symlinking files into Emacs&amp;rsquo;s load path. A packages in straight.el is defined as recipe as a files which was symlinked together. I have an article on recipe.</description>

      <description>Ask youself the following question.
 How do you know your understand something? How can you access much do you understand it? If you don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand it yet, is there a way you can make a snapshot of things that you don&amp;rsquo;t understand such that you can replace this snapshot whenever a better &amp;ldquo;version&amp;rdquo; available to you.  Why ability to assess your level of understanding it important? you asked.</description>

      <description>When I first get into Emacs, I was a vim user before, so I picked up Doom Emacs without experience with vanilla Emacs. Transition has been smooth so far, but because I never has experience with Vanilla Emacs before when I encounter a bug in Doom Emacs. I always have to first figure out if it is Doom Emacs problem or Emacs problems. Because of this, I put out a new blog series to help me build a stronger foundation of Vanilla Emacs.</description>

      <description>This article is an opinion piece on Comparison to other package managers.
Emacs package manager are split into 2 categories: package.el wrapper or not package.el wrapper.
One idea that straight.el emphasizes a lot is that straight.el manages commits rather than managing a whole a package. Some PM only accept latest commit. Other only accepts repo on github etc. I call this design decision a &amp;ldquo;smallest unit of design implementation.&amp;rdquo;
Other unique takes on managing Emacs packages are Borg (assimilates packages as Git submodules into .</description>

      <description>Personally, I think snippets is under untilize. Same as notes. The fact is people just don&amp;rsquo;t do neither snippets or notes.
I defined code snippet as followed
 A collection of either small/large code which may store in single/multiple files that you will revisit against in the future.
 Focusing on manging code snippets in emacs, few packages come to mind including: yassnipet, auto-yasnippet, yankpad, and code library.
In my workflow, to share code snippet with others, gists is needed.</description>

      <description>Org-ref manage citation entry, referenced citation, PDF, and note just fine. But the problem arise when trying to link notes created org-ref as a node in org roam. This is the problem that orb solve to allow PDF notes to be inserted as a org roam node. To summarize, the problem that orb solve to integrate org-ref functionalities into org-roam ecosystem.
All org roam does is the following:

      <description>Dev logs is new blog series which dive deep into implementation level. The goal is to understand how things works. I figure this should be an interesting series because I always wanted to know how these program works underneath. Instead of explaining the whole code base, I will only focus on the &amp;ldquo;magical&amp;rdquo; part that sparked my interest the most.
Todays I present to you aya.
I started of the series with aya because, I think, it is a small package with the right portion of magic.</description>

Yasnippet keymaps are in this category. emulation-mode-map-alists. Apparently, its more multi-mode keymap management. I am not sure what this means, but if i have to guess it is used in modes that have its known key precedence or other complexity that its key binding system brings.</description>

      <description>You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:
`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`
Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file.</description>

      <description>Prerequisite of this blog assumes that you already setup hugo blog by going through hugo quick start documentation.
This blog is published via approaches presented in this blog.
Org mode subtree is just one of the bullet point (aka. header) within org mode. As the title suggested, this article publication workflow allows one to publish subsection of a content within one of org mode header as a full page article. Main advantage of this method is that user doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to move content from the original location.</description>

I want to set repeating task to have the following functions
 when I change from TODO state to DONE state, a header block will log &amp;ldquo;state changes&amp;rdquo; with time stamp.  That is all the requirement I need for recurring tasks.
This can be done by setting the following

From an hour of digging, I discovered that tramp is really specific in term of how it read terminal prompt (aka PS1 environment variable.). It also limited in types of terminal, specified by TERM environment variables. TERM must match tramp terminal default setting (tramp-terminal-type).

      <description>Doom Emacs has its own keybinding system. A more accurate access would be Doom Emacs keybinding system is a wrapper over evil mode such that it is smoothly compatible with Emacs.
If you use Evil mode without Emacs configuration framework such as Spacemacs or Doom Emacs, it is frustrating to know if your keybinding is setup properly and will always work as expected at any circumstances. The usually point of failure is when your keybinding is overwritten by other packages.</description>

      <description>The normal workflow of lookup documentation would be to search google, stack-overflow, etc. Alternatively, if you are using IDE, IDE will lookup documentation for you, for example goto-definition etc. Very convenience. What else do you need?
Although, searching online directly is not the best approach, it is everyone last line of defense. On the other hands, IDE is as good as it gets. However, the problem with IDE is that it is context specific.</description>

      <description>One of principle I follow is
 never rely on others&amp;rsquo; people goodwill. and always expect other to be evil when it is possible.
 In quote , type of evil falls into incompetent evil and irresponsible evil. Putting this principle into practice, one must understand structures that govern behavior of people given a particular pursuit of goal.
In this scenario, I refers structure as git log and a particular pursuite of goal as learning and understanding a piece of code such as open source code.</description>

      <description>ref  How to commit better with Git.    Rule of thumb, from here.
 Whenever I have something that works (meaning, doesn&amp;rsquo;t break anything for anyone else) I&amp;rsquo;ll do a check-in. I write most of my stuff test first, so that means every time I have a new test that passes, I check-in.
In practice that means a few times per hour. At least a couple of times every hour, with 5 being quite a bit.</description>
